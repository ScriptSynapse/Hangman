# 🎯 Hangman Game with ASCII Art

A simple **Hangman** game implemented in Python, featuring **ASCII art** for a fun visual experience. Guess the letters of a hidden word before the hangman is complete!

## Features

* 🎨 **ASCII Art** to display hangman stages.
* 📝 Random word selection from a predefined list.
* ✅ Tracks guessed letters and prevents duplicate guesses.
* ⚠️ Input validation to ensure only single letters are accepted.
* 🎉 Win/Lose messages with the full word revealed.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository or download the `hangman.py` file.

2. Run the game using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

3. Enter a **single letter** at a time to guess the word.

4. Try to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.

5. Win by guessing all letters correctly. Lose if you run out of attempts.

## Example

```
🎯 Welcome to Hangman with ASCII Art!
Guess the word: _ _ _ _ _ _

❌ 'a' is not in the word. Attempts left: 5
